Thanks to Github User [xslittlegrass](https://github.com/xslittlegrass). With this project I was able to understand YOLO easily, I have added comments in the lines where I find it difficult to understand.

This is a hobby project. Right now I am working on writing a training file and following the code of [YOLO-Darknet](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/). I will update the code as soon as possible.
